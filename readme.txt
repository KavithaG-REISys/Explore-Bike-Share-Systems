Explore bike share systems:
---------------------------

This project is aimed at exploring data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. In this project I import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. The script takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics using Python3 , NumPy and pandas.


The following are the website used for reference while doing the project:
